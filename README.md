# HiCo-AutoML
## Environment Setting
This study conducted 50 experiments (10 experiments for each of the 5 datasets) on the Kaggle platform. The computational environment was configured with the Linux operating system (version 5.15.133+). The Python interpreter version was 3.7.12, compiled with GCC 9.4.0. Additionally, several Python packages were installed, including ConfigSpace-0.4.21, AutoSklearn-0.15.0, AutoKeras-1.0.20, TPOT-0.11.7, H2O-3.40.0.2, AutoGluon-0.6.2, distro-1.9.0, emcee-3.1.4, liac-arff-2.5.0, pynisher-0.6.4, pyrfr-0.8.3, scikit-learn-0.24.2, and SMAC-1.2.

## HiCo-AutoML Setting
In this study, the initial model parameters for the HiCo-AutoML framework were set with random_state=42 to ensure the reproducibility of experimental results, while all other parameters were kept at their default values as provided by the algorithm packages. Regarding evaluation metrics, R² was chosen as the default metric for regression tasks in HiCo-AutoML because it not only quantifies the average deviation between predicted and actual values but also normalizes this deviation relative to the total variance of the data, offering a more comprehensive assessment of the model’s predictive performance. For classification tasks, accuracy was selected as the default evaluation metric due to its intuitive interpretation and ability to succinctly measure overall model performance.
